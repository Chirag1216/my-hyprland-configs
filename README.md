# My First Arch Linux Rice

This repository contains the dotfiles for my personal desktop environment configuration, built on a minimal Arch Linux base.

### **Key Components**

This setup leverages the following tools to create a work-efficient, keyboard-driven workflow:

* **Hyprland:** A powerful and customizable Wayland compositor.
* **Waybar:** A highly configurable status bar.
* **Wofi:** A fast and simple application launcher.
* **Kitty:** A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.

### **Goals & Learnings**

The primary objective of this project was to create a simple, functional, and aesthetically pleasing desktop environment from a minimal Arch Linux installation. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with:

* **Git Version Control:** Managing and backing up configuration files.
* **Shell Scripting:** Automating parts of the system.
* **UI/UX Customization:** Configuring the visual elements to create a cohesive theme.
* **Linux File System:** Understanding the `~/.config` hierarchy and how applications store their settings.

This was my first major dive into system customization, and it served as a foundational learning experience in building a personal computing environment from the ground up.
